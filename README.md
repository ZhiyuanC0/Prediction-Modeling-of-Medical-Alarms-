# Prediction-Modeling-of-Medical-Alarms-
This project implements a machine learning-based system to predict medical alarm conditions from patient data using Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) decision rules. The goal is to accurately identify alarm states while minimizing false alarms and missed detections, which is critical in healthcare monitoring.
